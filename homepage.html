    <h3>Injera</h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

   <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup teff flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>peanut or vegetable oil</li>
       
   </ul>

   <h4>Equipment</h4>

   <ul>
   <li>a mixing bowl</li>
   <li>a nonstick pan or cast-iron skillet</li>

   </ul>


<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    
    <li>Put the teff flour in the bottom of a mixing bowl, and sift in the all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Slowly add the water, stirring to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Put the batter aside for a day or more (up to three days) to allow it to ferment. In this time, your injera batter will start to bubble and acquire the slight tanginess for which it�s known. Note: If you find that your injera batter does not ferment on its own, try adding a teaspoon of yeast.</li>
    <li>Stir in the salt.</li>
    <li>Heat a nonstick pan or lightly oiled cast-iron skillet until a water
            drop dances on the surface. Make sure the surface of the pan is smooth: Otherwise, your injera might fall apart when you try to remove it.</li>
    <li>Coat the pan with a thin layer of batter. Injera should be thicker than a cr�pe, but not as thick as a traditional pancake. It will rise slightly when it heats.</li>

<h4>Cooking</h4>

        <li>Cook until holes appear on the surface of the bread. Once the surface is dry, remove the bread from the pan and let it cool.</li>
